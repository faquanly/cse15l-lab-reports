#**LAB REPORT 1**
#
- Here are some basic filesystem commands I've learned from the lab:
   - Use "git clone" to copy folder/files from the directory by using key work "git clone" and follow by directory link.
   - Use "java" command to run a .java file on terminal
   - Use "pwd" command to show the current working directory.
   - Use "cd" command to change the working directory.
   - Use "ls" command to list the files in the directory.
   - Use "cat" command to read a file.
1. Example of using "cd" command without argument:
   - ![cd with no argument](image-cd1.png)
